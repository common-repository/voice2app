== Description ==

If you are a podcaster looking for a way to transcribe audio files or a blogger that would like to have your post narrated using google narration, then Voice2App.com is the SaaS tool for you.  One tool three great features.

Voice2App is a cloud-based membership service that contains three tools. The three tools are Voice Messaging, Transcription and Narration. This is a membership that will include more services that are identified by members or become available by AWS, Google and Azure.  This plugin does require you to signup for the service at [Voice2App Pricing](https://voice2app.com/pricing),  All narrations and voice messages are stored in the cloud and can be listened to and manipulated both in the plugin and on Voice2App. 

The plugin currently only includes the ability for working with the features below.  

-	Voice Messaging - Users can leave voice messages with the click of a button.  The message is sent to the site owner
 	as an audio file in an email and stored on Voice2App.  
-	Narration - Convert any page or article to audio for users to listen.  Convert using the plugin and manipulate on Voice2App.

Currently the transcription feature is only available on Voice2App.  Login and upload your audio file and the system will
asynchronously convert it to text and store it for easy access on Voice2App.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Voice2App plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the Voice2App plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Signup for a free account on Voice2App.  (https://voice2app.com/pricing)  Take note of the email you used for the account.
Next, go to the Profile Settings page and copy the API Key.  The email and key will be used to setup the Voice2App plugin. 
4. Use the Settings->Voice2App screen to configure the plugin.  Enter the email and key from step three.  Enter a voice
message popup name and if you have your own image for the popup you can upload it using the Choose File feature.  By default,
the system uses the blue button provided by Voice2App.   Finally, select the size of the popup.  I recommend using “Tiny”.  
Once all items entered click Save Changes.
5. To add the Voice Messaging popup simply add [voice2app-popup] to the area of the page or post where you want the blue
button displayed.  
6. The Narration functionality is displayed at the bottom of your pages and posts in WordPress admin.  You simply open the
page/post and scroll to the bottom.  You will see a button and input field for Voice2App.  Simply click the button and the
text from the page/post will be sent to Voice2App and be narrated using your selected voice.   The system will return a link
to your new audio file.  You can cut and past the file above and presto your page/post now has an audio file so that people can listen.
